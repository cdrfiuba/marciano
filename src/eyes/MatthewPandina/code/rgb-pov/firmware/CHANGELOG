Updated Makefile, tlc5940.c, tlc5940.h to use the newest multiplexing code,
which has some major speed improvements. Also data.c, data.h were updated to
conform to the new way that the grayscale data is arranged in the new library.

Note: Any pre-existing data.c file will need to be regenerated using the
      new png2tlc code in the software/ directory.
