CONNECTING THE HARDWARE

Depending on how many TLC5940 chips are linked in series, you may have
to change the TLC5940_N variable in firmware/Makefile.

If TLC5940_USART_MSPIM = 0 in firmware/Makefile, connect the hardware
according to ../../schematics/multiplexing.sch, or
../../schematics/multiplexing-multi.sch depending on how many TLC5940
chips are linked in series.

If TLC5940_USART_MSPIM = 1 in firmware/Makefile, connect the hardware
according to ../../schematics/usart_mspim-multiplexing.sch, or
../../schematics/usart_mspim-multiplexing-multi.sch depending on how
many TLC5940 chips are linked in series.
