Demystifying the TLC5940 - Chapter 9

Instructions:

  1. Verify that DEVICE, CLOCK, PROGRAMMER, and FUSES are set
     correctly in the Makefile based on your hardware. The provided
     Makefile is configured for an ATmega328P running at 20 MHz,
     using an AVR ISP mkII programmer, with FUSES set to remove the
     clock divider, to use the external crystal, and to enable clock
     output.

     The COMPILE parameter is set to use the non-standard -mint8
     option, so beware if you are add code that is incompatible with
     -mint8 such as some functions that are part of avr-libc, and any
     code that doesn't use the defines from <stdint.h>.

  2. To build, type `make`

  3. To set the fuse bits, type `make fuse`

  4. To program the AVR, type `make flash`
